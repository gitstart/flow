## What is flow?

Flow is a daily planner to keep you in the flow. It's an open-source you can self-host, so you can change anything about it.

Flow is a state of mind where you are fully immersed in an activity. You are completely focused on the task at hand, and you are fully engaged in the activity. You are in the zone.

## Flow vs Sunsama

If you've used Sunsama, you'll notice that Flow is very similar. The main difference is that Flow is an open-source project you self-host. This means that you can run your own instance of Flow and have full control over it and your data.

It was primarily created as Sunsama does not have a Linear integration and I wanted to be able to easily import Linear issues into my daily plan.

## Why Typescript?

Typescript, although not the most loved language, strikes a good balance of:

- Being a good first language to learn, making it easy to onboard new contributors that may not have much experience with programming.
- Being typesafe, which makes it easier to refactor with peace in mind.
- Having a decent ecosystem of tools and libraries.
- Being a good language to write a web application in, for both the frontend and backend.

## Contribute

If you have suggestions for how Flow could be improved, or want to report a bug, open an issue! Any and all contributions are welcome.
